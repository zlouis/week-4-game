# week-4-game
For this week's game, I made a game that generated random numbers and users click on images to try to match the correct number or else they lose. Its about feeding a bear with corresponding food or images. 

Some of the challenges I had making the game were resetting the game after the user wins or loses. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to reset the counter to 0 when the game ends. The coding is not what I would like and has a lot of repeating codes. I will come back to this project and clean up the codes and delve more deeply into these issues.
